spac
====
split a file in m parts such that n are needed to recover

Installation
------------
inside the project directory

    make && su -c 'make install'

Usage
-------
Read the manual pages or invoke the utilities without arguments

Implementation
--------------
If n is equal to m, files Fi get random data Ri for i in 1..n-1,
then Fn gets ([x]Ri, i in 1..n-1)

If n is less than m, files Fi get Ri for i in 1..m, then for c in mCn,
Fi = ([smin]Fx, x in c), gets ([x]Rj, j in 1..n, j != i)

If the files provided are more than the ones needed, only the first group
will be used.

The file signature is [0x80, e, n, m, s], where e is the element number,
s the original file size and n, m the user provided parameters.
The inspact utility can be used to query file signature

The xspac utility can be used to check if two groups produce the same output.
If the files provided are more than the ones needed, only the first* group
containing the first file and the first* group not containing the first file
will be used.

*first as the first group of files by element matching the stable permutation
generator, not in lexicographic order by name
